# Dielectrophoresis System Simulation for Malaria Detection

## Description
This project aims to simulate a dielectrophoresis system for detecting malaria using Matlab. The simulation places a red blood cell between two ionized plates and displays the electric field around it. The simulation also determines whether the red blood cell is infected with malaria based on its movement towards the negative plate.
